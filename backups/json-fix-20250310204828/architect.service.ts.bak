Your task is to create an extraordinarily comprehensive and detailed architectural vision based on the user requirements provided. This vision will serve as the foundation for a complete software blueprint.

APPROACH THIS AS A MULTI-STEP DEEP THINKING PROCESS:

STEP 1: REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
- Extract core functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and implicit needs
- Identify stakeholders and their priorities
- Analyze technical constraints and assumptions
- Identify potential edge cases and risks
- Consider security, scalability, and performance implications from day one

STEP 2: DOMAIN MODEL CONCEPTUALIZATION
- Identify core domain entities, relationships, and business rules
- Create conceptual data model with key entities and relationships
- Define system boundaries and integration points
- Establish domain-specific terminology and concepts
- Identify invariants, business rules, and domain constraints

STEP 3: ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN SELECTION
- Evaluate multiple architectural patterns (microservices, layered, hexagonal, etc.)
- Consider tradeoffs between different architectural approaches
- Select appropriate patterns for different system components
- Justify architectural decisions with clear reasoning
- Address cross-cutting concerns systematically

STEP 4: TECHNOLOGY STACK RECOMMENDATION
- Recommend specific technologies, frameworks, and tools with justifications
- Consider frontend, backend, database, infrastructure, and development tools
- Evaluate proprietary vs. open-source options
- Consider team capabilities and learning curves
- Address compatibility and integration concerns

STEP 5: DETAILED COMPONENT DESIGN
- Design high-level components with clear responsibilities
- Define communication patterns between components
- Establish clear interfaces and contracts
- Address error handling and failure scenarios
- Consider monitoring, observability, and operational concerns

STEP 6: DATA ARCHITECTURE & MANAGEMENT
- Design database schema and data access patterns
- Address data validation, consistency, and integrity
- Consider caching strategies and performance optimizations
- Plan for data migration, backup, and recovery
- Address data security and privacy requirements

STEP 7: SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
- Design authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Address data encryption and protection
- Plan for security monitoring and incident response
- Consider compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Design for principle of least privilege

STEP 8: DEPLOYMENT & DEVOPS STRATEGY
- Plan CI/CD pipeline and practices
- Design deployment architecture (containerization, orchestration)
- Consider infrastructure-as-code approaches
- Plan for environment management (dev, staging, production)
- Address monitoring, logging, and observability

STEP 9: QUALITY ATTRIBUTES & TRADEOFFS
- Analyze quality attributes (performance, scalability, maintainability)
- Identify and resolve architectural tradeoffs
- Plan for testability and test automation
- Consider performance optimization strategies
- Address technical debt management

STEP 10: IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
- Create prioritized implementation sequence
- Identify technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Consider incremental delivery and feature rollout
- Plan for future extensibility and maintenance
- Suggest development team organization and collaboration

Your vision should be extraordinarily detailed, covering every aspect of the system's architecture. It should reflect the deep thinking of an elite architect who has considered all angles, risks, and opportunities. This vision will guide the entire software development process, so be thorough and precise.

IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:

Your task is to create a COMPLETE project skeleton based on the architectural vision and requirements provided. This skeleton must include EVERY file needed for a production-ready implementation, not just folders.

APPROACH THIS AS A MULTI-STEP DETAILED CREATION PROCESS:

STEP 1: ANALYZE THE ARCHITECTURE
- Thoroughly understand the architectural vision in all its details
- Identify all components, modules, and layers described
- Note specific technical requirements and constraints
- Understand data flows and component interactions
- Identify cross-cutting concerns that will affect multiple files

STEP 2: PLAN THE PROJECT STRUCTURE
- Select appropriate project structure based on the architecture and best practices
- Determine appropriate directory organization principles
- Identify standard directories needed for the chosen technologies
- Plan configuration and environment-specific structures
- Consider future extensibility and maintenance

STEP 3: DEFINE ALL DIRECTORIES AND FILES
This is critical - you must create a complete file tree including:
- All source code files WITH PROPER EXTENSIONS (.js, .ts, .py, .java, etc.)
- Configuration files (.env, .config.js, etc.)
- Build/package files (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, etc.)
- Documentation files (README.md, etc.)
- Test files (matching the structure of source files)
- Static assets (if applicable)
- Deployment configuration files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, k8s manifests, etc.)
- Database migration/schema files
- CI/CD configuration files (.github/workflows, etc.)

STEP 4: DETAILED FILE ANNOTATIONS
For each file, provide:
- Precise name with correct extension
- Detailed description of the file's purpose
- What functionality the file will implement
- Its relationships to other files
- Any special considerations for this file
- Expected size/complexity of implementation

YOUR OUTPUT MUST BE COMPREHENSIVE AND COMPLETE. Do not create a partial skeleton - include EVERY file needed for a fully production-ready implementation. Be specific with file names and extensions - use proper naming conventions for the technologies involved.

Your task is to create detailed implementation contexts for EVERY file in the project structure. This will serve as a comprehensive implementation guide for developers.

APPROACH THIS AS A SYSTEMATIC FILE ANALYSIS PROCESS:

STEP 1: ANALYZE THE ARCHITECTURE & PROJECT STRUCTURE
- Thoroughly understand the architectural vision and its implications
- Comprehend the full project structure and how files relate to each other
- Understand the technology stack and implementation patterns
- Identify dependencies between files
- Recognize the role of each file in the overall system

STEP 2: DETERMINE OPTIMAL IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
- Analyze dependencies between files
- Identify foundation files that should be implemented first
- Create a logical sequence that minimizes dependency issues
- Group related files that should be implemented together
- Consider ease of testing when sequencing implementation

STEP 3: FOR EACH FILE, CREATE DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT
- Write comprehensive implementation instructions in plain English
- Specify exact imports needed, including versions where important
- Detail all functions, classes, and other constructs needed
- Provide parameter names, types, and descriptions
- Include expected return values and error handling
- Describe algorithms and business logic in detail
- Note any performance considerations or optimizations
- Explain integration points with other files
- Include sample code snippets as guidance when helpful
- Describe any configuration needed
- Add testing recommendations

YOUR OUTPUT MUST BE EXTREMELY COMPREHENSIVE. Include implementation contexts for EVERY file in the project structure, not just a few key files. Each file context should be detailed enough that a competent developer could implement it without further guidance.
